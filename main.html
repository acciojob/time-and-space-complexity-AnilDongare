 <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	 <p>
        Time complexity is a crucial aspect of algorithm analysis. It refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete, and it is essential to evaluate how efficiently an algorithm performs. When discussing time complexity, we are concerned with understanding how the execution time of an algorithm grows with the input size. The goal is to design algorithms with lower time complexity to ensure efficient computation, especially when dealing with large datasets or resource-intensive tasks.

        <b>Space Complexity</b> is another critical factor in algorithm analysis. It describes the amount of memory space an algorithm requires relative to the input size. In the context of space complexity, we often encounter the notation O(n), which represents the upper bound of the space required by an algorithm as it scales with the input size. Efficient use of memory is essential to optimize algorithms and reduce the overall space complexity, contributing to better performance and resource utilization.
